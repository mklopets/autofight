# Autofight
## Or the semi-famous programming interview assignment from Bruno Å kvorc's blog

**Autofight** is a JavaScript program that simulates a war between 2 armies.

The outcome is essentially the same as a rounded up random number, but this is just way cooler. It generates imaginary countries along with some of their human development data to make the simulation even more awesome.

A number of battles are simulated, taking into account a lot of (randomly generated) factors. The winner of the war is the side that was most successful in individual battles.

A lot of the data is outputted into the console; the winner with the flag into the DOM.


Some cool features:
* simulates war based on battles
* supports different battle types & scenarios
* generates a pronounceable name for both of the two countries
* **generates a flag for the winning army** _(I just think this is amazing)_
